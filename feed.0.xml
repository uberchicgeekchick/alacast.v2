		<itunes:summary>More questions are raised in this episode (like there weren't enough already).

Does Sheanna'Ree really know someone who can help Jim Bob? And even more importantly, will he?

What the heck has happened to Bobby John?

Is the Galactic Counsel still searching for Earth?

Believe it or not, there will be some answers. Jim Bob also goes a little crazy. And just what is going on with MegaDan?

I had a lot of fun writing this episode on the way to and back from Balticon. I hope you enjoy it.

Once again we get to see more of Zeke. We also are introduced to a brand new character who seems to be in some trouble. What kind of trouble is hard to say but it has got to be bad if she is looking for help from the humans. It also looks like the Galactic Counsel led by Vice-Chancellor Greklor is gearing up for a war against humanity. Things look pretty grim.

		<itunes:summary>Hello, my friends. Well, the group consensus seems to be that the name for fans of GalaxyBillies should be "Kinfolk". So a big "HEY" to all the Kinfolk out there. In honour of this momentous occasion I'm going to setup a page for GalaxyBillies with a show description and link to all the episodes. I'm also going to set up a page for all the kinfolk out there.

So here's what I'd like you to do: send me your name or Internet handle to kinfolk at irreverentmuse dot com and I'll generate a kinfolk name for you. Those I will post on the kinfolk page. I won't be doing anything more with them (yet), but I'm noodling on what would be appropriate. Let's have some fun with this.

Zeke is the hero and main POV character in this episode and you know that can't be good. We also see that the Galaxy is taknig a greater and more menacing interest in the humans.

Finally, there have been a few of you (maybe more that I'm not aware of) spreading the word. Please continue to do so. I have also created a Group (http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=372503069110&amp;ref=ts) and a Fan Page (http://www.facebook.com/pages/Michell-Plesteds-GalaxyBillies/406961900026?ref=ts) on Facebook.

They aren't on the planet very long before they discover that they may not be alone.

I also want to propose the name "The Kinfolk" for you fans out there. What do you think? Leave me a comment, send me a voicemail or whatever to let me know.

		<itunes:summary>OK, I know it has been three weeks since the last episode of GalaxyBillies and for that I apologize. As you may (or may not) know, I sold a character spot for GB on TheBoomEffect. That spot was purchased by MegaDan Scholes. This is the first episode that his voice will appear. I created a special new spot for him that I think will be a lot of fun going forward.

I'd love to hear what you think.

In this episode the humans finally get off Sin Station (or do they?). We also find that the galaxy at large is starting to notice them. For better of worse, they are out there.

I'm still waiting for suggestions around what you, my fans, want to be called. Maybe you don't want to be called anything at all. That's fine too. Just let me know, OK?

There have been a few of you (maybe more that I'm not aware of) spreading the word. Please continue to do so. I have also created a Group (http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=372503069110&amp;ref=ts) and a Fan Page (http://www.facebook.com/pages/Michell-Plesteds-GalaxyBillies/406961900026?ref=ts) on Facebook. If you feel so motivated, please join one or both.

Enjoy the episode.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Before you ask, no, I didn't purposely make you wait extra long for this episode because of all the cliffhangers in the last one. Honest. To do so would make me an overly evil bastard and, as my grandmother might have told you, I am nothing, if not angelic and considerate of everyone's feelings.

Now don't you feel better knowing that? :)

In this episode we finally find out what has become of Jim Bob and we learn a bit more about Bobby John. We also have a new character show up to make things interesting.

A couple things

As many of you know, the auction for "The Boom Effect" took place on February 27, 2010 to raise money for a trust fund for Tee Morris' daughter, Sonic Boom. The auction was a HUGE success taking in over $8,000 and I'm very pleased that "GalaxyBillies" was part of that. Our winning bidder for the character spot should show up in the next episode; I've got an idea that I think will really be awesome that I'm working on right now. I'm not going to reveal who the winning bidder is (yet), but I think he'll be great.

This does pose a minor problem, however. It may mean a 3-week delay before the next episode of "GalaxyBillies". I beg your patience while I put this together.

I also posed the question: "Do you, my listeners, want to be called anything?" For example, Christiana Ellis had "Casey's Cadets" for "Space Casey". If you have ideas/suggestions, send them my way. I know it's been done many, MANY times before, but I think it could be fun.

Finally, I need your help. I need comments and feedback, as always (iTunes, the website, email, voicemail), and I also need you to spread the word. I've seen a few of you bring up the podcast on Twitter which I REALLY appreciate. Thank you and keep it up.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Hello Everyone,

In this episode, the humans finally have a chance to stretch their legs. They have been cooped up way too long since being kidnapped by the Grokmar and they are all going a bit stir-crazy.

They all decide to split up to do their own things. Betty Sue, Carol Anne and Bobby John go shopping while Jim Bob and Zeke go looking for a night on the town.

Five humans who have never left the mountains loose on an alien space station. What could possibly go wrong?

		<itunes:summary>Hey Folks,

The Earthlings learn a little more about their home on the Grokmar. They come to realize that the ship really doesn't understand them at all. They threaten a hunger strike and the ship reluctantly gives in to their demands: proper food and a place to sleep. The ship adamantly refuses to return them to Earth. It maintains its claim to need them in order to continue its mission... except, it doesn't remember what its mission is.

I also have a special offer at the end of the show. This offer is to support the effort being taken to help out Tee Morris in his time of need. Please see the following two URL's for more information about the problem and give some consideration to my offer in support of it. http://www.theboomeffect.org/ http://www.teeandserena.chipin.com

Enjoy the show and, as always, if you have any feedback, please leave a voicemail at 206-203-2031 or email me at galaxybilly at irreverentmuse dot com.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Happy Holidays everyone! As a special treat, I am putting the first episode of my new podcast project into the feed.

GalaxyBillies is the story of five hillbillies who are kidnapped by a semi-sentient starship. To say they take the universe by storm would be a MAJOR understatement.

I was checking my notes a couple days ago when I was finishing the first episode and I realized I first had the story idea almost a year ago. It has taken a while to germinate, but I'm very happy with episode one (numbered episode 0).

Have a listen and let me know what you think. If you like it, leave a comment and maybe feedback on iTunes. If you don't, please let me know that too. I thrive on feedback in case you didn't already know it.

Enjoy.
